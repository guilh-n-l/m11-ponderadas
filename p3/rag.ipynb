    "# RAG Using Pre-trained model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** will be implemented using a pre-trained model, leveraging **cosine similarity** for document retrieval. The goal is to improve the model's responses by augmenting it with relevant, external information retrieved from a document corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview of the Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set Up Corpus**: This involves preparing a collection of documents that the retrieval system will search through to find relevant information when a query is made.\n",
    "1. **Index Documents**: The corpus of documents will be indexed and embedded to facilitate efficient retrieval.\n",
    "1. **Set Up Retrieval System**: A retrieval mechanism will be established, using cosine similarity to identify relevant documents from a corpus.\n",
    "1. **Load Pre-trained Model**: A generative model will be loaded for response generation.\n",
    "1. **Retrieve Relevant Information**: Cosine similarity will be used to query the indexed documents and fetch the most relevant ones.\n",
    "1. **Generate Response**: The generative model will produce a response, utilizing the retrieved documents as context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections will delve into the detailed implementation of each step."

      "According to valid sources: An island or isle is a piece of land, distinct from a continent, completely surrounded by water. There are continental islands, which were formed by being split from a continent by plate tectonics, and oceanic islands, which have never been part of a continent. Oceanic islands can be formed from volcanic activity, grow into atolls from coral reefs, and form from sediment along shorelines, creating barrier islands. River islands can also form from sediment and debris in rivers. Artificial islands are those made by humans, including small rocky outcroppings built out of lagoons and large-scale land reclamation projects used for development.\n",
      "Islands are host to diverse plant and animal life. Oceanic islands have the sea as a natural barrier to the introduction of new species, causing the species that do reach the island to evolve in isolation. Continental islands share animal and plant life with the continent they split from. Depending on how long ago the continental island formed, the life on that island may have diverged greatly from the mainland due to natural selection.\n",
      "Humans have lived on and traveled between islands for thousands of years at a minimum. Some islands became host to humans due to a land bridge or a continental island splitting from the mainland, or by boat travel. In the far north or south some islands are joined by seasonal or glacial ice. Today, up to 10% of the world's population lives on islands. Islands are popular targets for tourism due to their perceived natural beauty, isolation, and unique cultures.\n",
      "Islands became the target of colonization by Europeans, resulting in the majority of islands in the Pacific being put under European control. Decolonization has resulted in some but not all island nations becoming self-governing, with lasting effects related to industrialisation, invasive species, nuclear weapons testing, and tourism. Islands and island countries are threatened by climate change. Sea level rise threatens to submerge nations such as Maldives, the Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu completely. Increases in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones can cause widespread destruction of infrastructure and animal habitats. Species that live exclusively on islands are some of those most threatened by extinction.\n",

       "\"Based on your interest in living in a place surrounded by water, here are some options to consider:\\n\\n1. Oceanic Islands: These are islands that have never been part of a continent and are formed through volcanic activity, coral reef growth, or sediment deposition along shorelines. Examples include Hawaii, Bali, and the Maldives.\\n2. Continental Islands: These are islands that were once part of a continent but have since been separated by plate tectonics. Examples include Great Britain, Honshu (Japan), and the Australian mainland.\\n3. River Islands: These are formed through sediment deposition in rivers and can be found in various locations around the world. Examples include the Thousand Islands in Canada and New York State, and the Sunderbans in India and Bangladesh.\\n4. Artificial Islands: These are islands created by humans through land reclamation projects or small rocky outcroppings built out of lagoons. Examples include the Palm Jumeirah in Dubai and the man-made islands of Singapore.\\n5. Small Rocky Outcroppings: These are small, rocky formations that have been formed by geological processes and can be found in various locations around the world.

Some islands may have a more relaxed pace of life, while others may be more densely populated and urbanized. Additionally, some islands may have unique plant and animal life that could make for interesting and diverse wildlife viewing opportunities.\\n\\nIt's also worth noting that many island nations have experienced colonization and decolonization, which have had lasting effects on their cultures, economies, and political systems. Today, many islands are facing threats such as climate change, sea level rise, and the introduction of invasive species.

      "According to valid sources: C (pronounced  – like the letter c) is a general-purpose programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems code (especially in kernels), device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing. C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.\n",
      "A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers available for practically all modern computer architectures and operating systems. The book The C Programming Language, co-authored by the original language designer, served for many years as the de facto standard for the language. C has been standardized since 1989 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and, subsequently, jointly by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).\n",
      "C is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code.\n",
